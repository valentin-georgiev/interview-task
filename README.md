# Interview task

Pre-written React app which fetches placeholder data from - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users and renders the users with a filter field to search by name. Please, have in mind that it works as EXACT search. Be careful about uppercase and lowercase characters.

1. Be sure you use node v16+
2. npm install
3. npm run start

# Features:
